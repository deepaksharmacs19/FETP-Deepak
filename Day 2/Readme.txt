What I have used and who can access the application: Hello there, in this project, I have used Google cloud for gmail api. And in the gmail API, we have specified that the application is in testing or production phase. So in that case, I have chosen the testing phase because if we choose production then it takes 3-5 days to verify and many other things. [Screenshot 1 day 2]
And that's why I have used the testing phase. And in testing phase we have to specify the users who can test the application. [Screenshot 2 day 2] So I have added Chidambar Sir's gmail and my own gmail and trying to add the gmail evaluators@formulaq.io, but as its a Google Group email, it can't be added. [Screenshot 3, day 2] I have given all the screenshots of the proof in day 2 images.

The remaining screenshots are related to the project. And in order to see the output, you will have to open the console of browser [Screenshot 9,8 day 2]. The application is working as expected.

Thank you.
